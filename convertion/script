#Unit Conversion:

MT/M: Multiplied by 12 to get MT/A.
T/M: Multiplied by 12 to get T/A.
Kg/D: Converted to MT/A using value _ 365 / 1000.
KL/D: Converted to KL/A using value _ 365.
Lit/M: Converted to KL/A using value _ 12 / 1000.
Kg/M: Converted to MT/A using value _ 12 / 1000.
Handles Multi-Line Strings:

Processes multi-line cells and combines results in a semicolon-separated format.
